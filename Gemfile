# Du to some changes in bundler, specifying dependencies with the `gemspec`
# keyword will trigger an error as `vagrant-bindfs` would then be declared
# twice, once here and once in the :plugins group.
#
# To work around this issue, development dependencies should be added to
# the :development group below instead of in `.gemspec` file.

  # We depend on Vagrant for development, but we don't add it as a
  # gem dependency because we expect to be installed within the
  # Vagrant environment itself using `vagrant plugin`.
